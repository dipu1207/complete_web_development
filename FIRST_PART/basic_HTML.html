      <strong>Bali</strong> is predominantly a Hindu country. Bali is known for
      its elaborate, traditional dancing. The dancing is inspired by its Hindi
      beliefs. Most of the dancing portrays tales of good versus evil. To watch
      the dancing is a breathtaking experience. Lombok has some impressive
      points of interest the majestic Gunung Rinjani is an active volcano. It is
      the second highest peak in Indonesia. Art is a Balinese passion. Batik
      paintings and carved statues make popular souvenirs. Artists can be seen
      whittling and painting on the streets, particularly in Ubud.

      It is easy to appreciate each island as an attractive tourist destination.
      Majestic scenery; rich culture; white sands and warm, azure waters draw
      visitors like magnets every year. Snorkelling and diving around the nearby
      Gili Islands is magnificent. Marine fish, starfish, turtles and coral reef
      are present in abundance. Bali and Lombok are part of the Indonesian
      archipelago. Bali has some spectacular temples. The most significant is
      the Mother Temple, Besakih. The inhabitants of Lombok are mostly Muslim
      with a Hindu minority. Lombok remains the most understated of the two
      islands. Lombok has several temples worthy of a visit, though they are
      less prolific. Bali and Lombok are neighbouring islands.
