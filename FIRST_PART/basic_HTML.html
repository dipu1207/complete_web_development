		its elaborate, traditional dancing. The dancing is inspired by its Hindi
		beliefs. Most of the dancing portrays tales of good versus evil. To watch
		the dancing is a breathtaking experience. Lombok has some impressive
		points of interest the majestic Gunung Rinjani is an active volcano. It is
		the second highest peak in Indonesia. Art is a Balinese passion. Batik

		It is easy to appreciate each island as an attractive tourist destination.
		Majestic scenery; rich culture; white sands and warm, azure waters draw
		visitors like magnets every year. Snorkelling and diving around the nearby
		Gili Islands is magnificent. Marine fish, starfish, turtles and coral reef
		are present in abundance. Bali and Lombok are part of the Indonesian
		archipelago. Bali has some spectacular temples. The most significant is
		the Mother Temple, Besakih. The inhabitants of Lombok are mostly Muslim
		with a Hindu minority. Lombok remains the most understated of the two
		islands. Lombok has several temples worthy of a visit, though they are
		less prolific. Bali and Lombok are neighbouring islands.
